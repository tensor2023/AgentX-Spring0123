# Context Compression

Every message in your conversation takes up space in the model's context window. In long sessions, you'll eventually hit the limit — the AI loses access to earlier messages and starts losing track of what you've discussed. Context compression solves this by intelligently condensing older messages while keeping the important parts.

This matters most when you're on extended coding sessions or using paid APIs where token usage affects cost.

## How It Works

The compression system preserves:

- Recent messages (kept at full detail)
- Key decisions and choices made
- File modifications and their outcomes
- Tool execution results

Older messages are summarized to their essential content.

## Manual Compression

Use the `/compact` command to manually compress your conversation history:

```bash
/compact              # Compress with default settings
/compact --preview    # Preview compression without applying
/compact --restore    # Restore from pre-compression backup
```

### Compression Modes

| Mode | Flag | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Default | (none) | Balanced compression - good for most cases |
| Conservative | `--conservative` | Preserves more content, less aggressive |
| Aggressive | `--aggressive` | Maximum compression, minimal content retention |

**Examples:**

```bash
/compact --aggressive    # Maximum token savings
/compact --conservative  # Preserve more detail
/compact --preview       # See what would be compressed
```

### Restore from Backup

Before compression is applied, a backup is automatically created. You can restore to the pre-compression state:

```bash
/compact --restore
```

> **Note:** Only one backup is stored at a time. A new compression overwrites the previous backup.

## Auto-Compact

Nanocoder can automatically compress the context when it reaches a certain percentage of the model's context limit.

### Configuration

Add auto-compact settings to your `agents.config.json`:

```json
{
  "nanocoder": {
    "autoCompact": {
      "enabled": true,
      "threshold": 60,
      "mode": "conservative",
      "notifyUser": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enable/disable auto-compact |
| `threshold` | number | `60` | Context usage percentage to trigger compression (50-95) |
| `mode` | string | `"conservative"` | Compression mode: `"default"`, `"conservative"`, `"aggressive"` |
| `notifyUser` | boolean | `true` | Show notification when auto-compact runs |

### Session Overrides

Override auto-compact settings for the current session without modifying config files:

```bash
/compact --auto-on           # Enable auto-compact for this session
/compact --auto-off          # Disable auto-compact for this session
/compact --threshold 75      # Set threshold to 75% for this session
```

Session overrides are temporary and reset when you restart Nanocoder.

## How Compression Works

### What Gets Compressed

1. **User messages** - Long messages are summarized
2. **Assistant messages** - Verbose responses are truncated
3. **Tool results** - Detailed outputs are reduced to key information

### What Gets Preserved

1. **System messages** - Always kept intact
2. **Recent messages** - Last 2 messages kept at full detail (configurable)
3. **Tool calls** - Structure preserved for conversation continuity
4. **Error information** - Error types and resolution status retained

### Compression Thresholds

| Content Type | Default Mode | Aggressive Mode | Conservative Mode |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| User messages | >500 chars | >500 chars | >1000 chars |
| Assistant messages | >500 chars | >500 chars | Preserved |
| Assistant w/ tools | >300 chars | >300 chars | Preserved |

## Viewing Context Usage

Use `/status` or `/usage` to see your current context utilization:

```bash
/status    # Shows context usage along with other status info
/usage     # Visual display of context usage
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use preview first** - Run `/compact --preview` to see the impact before committing
2. **Start conservative** - Use `--conservative` mode if you're unsure
3. **Set reasonable thresholds** - 60-70% is a good auto-compact threshold
4. **Monitor after compression** - Check that important context wasn't lost

## Troubleshooting

### "No backup available to restore"

This means either:
- No compression has been performed yet
- The backup was already restored and cleared
- Nanocoder was restarted (backups don't persist across sessions)

### Auto-compact not triggering

Check that:
1. Auto-compact is enabled in config or via `--auto-on`
2. Threshold is set appropriately (default is 60%)
3. Current usage is above the threshold (check with `/status`)

### Compression removed important context

1. Use `/compact --restore` immediately if backup is available
2. Consider using `--conservative` mode
3. Increase the threshold to delay compression
4. Disable auto-compact and use manual compression
